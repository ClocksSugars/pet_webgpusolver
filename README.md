# My pet WGPU heat equation solver
## Building and Running
Compile with [https://drager.github.io/wasm-pack/](wasm-pack) using the command `wasm-pack build --target web`. If running locally, load using some kind of local web server such as `python3 -m http.server`. Check [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API#browser_compatibility](your browser's compatibility) and if running linux then you'll want to run your browser with [https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status#implementation-status](these flags) in order to enable webgpu. If you run on desktop, run in a console and keep the window selected while typing for text to appear in the console (desktop use lacks many of the features of the browser version and exists in large part for debugging).
## Details and Numerical Considerations
See my write-up at [https://clockssugars.blog/articles/0126-heateq/](clockssugars.blog) for the explanation of the program works loosely in the form of a WGPU tutorial, along with a derivation of the heat equation and our numerical method, and a derivation of the stability regime and error characteristics of the method in the appendix.
